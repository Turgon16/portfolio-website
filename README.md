# Welcome!

Thanks so much for taking the time to check out my website and my GitHub.

Tyler.Dev is my portfolio/website showcase intended to give recruiters and potential future employers a quick glimpse into my skills and abilities.

## tyler-dev.vercel.app

I've developed Tyler.Dev using React.js for my front-end framework. For styling I've used a combination of Material UI's styling library, as well as some custom css implemented using my own custom style sheets.

My intention was to break down my page into small, easy to read and easy to modify component pieces. I did this so that in future iterations of the site I can easily include additional projects to showcase.

To deploy the website I've made use of Vercel's free deployment services.
